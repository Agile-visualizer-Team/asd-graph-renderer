*   This is the expected template file that will be used to generate a graph.
*   To be a valid graph-template it must have:
*       - A pair "template": "graph" which describe what kind of rappresentation the user aspire to;
*       - A key "nodes": containing all the information regarding the atom that will be used as a nodes-generator;
*       - A key "arch": containing all the information regarding the atom that will be used as a arches-generator;
*   These last two keys may contain:
*       - A key "atom", which contains information about it, such as the name of the atom used and its variables. MANDATORY FIELD
*       - A key "style", which describe how the nodes (root, leaves, nonRoot) or the arch will be rappresented. 
*         The user can define the colors to be used and if the arch are oriented or not. Whether the style tag is defined, 
*         all the information derived from the atom itself will be overwritten. Otherwise, if the atoms does not contains
*         information regarding the style they are going to be used default value. OPTIONAL FIELD
